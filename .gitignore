# .gitignore
#
# This files contains a list of files and directories that should be excepted
# from version control. The reason for excluding files or directories is
# either because the files/directories contain large binary blobs such as
# videos or images that are not required to run the site, or because the files
# contain sensitive information such as passwords or salts.
# To override a directory-wide exception for certain files, prepend the
# filename with !, for example:
#
#	directory/*				# ignore all files in directory...
#	!directory/README		# except for README, which should be versioned.
#
